# Candidate


This project is an *exercise*.

## Getting started

#### Prerequisites

As we're using a number of node.js tools. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


#### Install dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the AngularJS code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so you can simply do:

```
npm install
```

### Data & server API

The app use mocked up data for testing. The [post] /candidate end point has a randow fail of 20% to simulate server failure handling.

### Running the App during Development

The project comes pre-configured with a local development web server.  It is a node.js
tool called [live-server][live-server].  You can install live-server globally :

```
npm install -g live-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```console
cd ./app
live-server
```
You'll see instructions on how you need to proceed further.
